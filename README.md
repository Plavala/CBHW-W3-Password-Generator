# CBHW-W3-Password-Generator
Week 3 home work for JavaScript. Password generator.

## Description
For the 3rd homework we were tasked to create the javascript for a password generator. Both the CSS and HTML were provided and a starter Script was given to us to be able to start the javascript. We were asked to create various prompts for what should be included in the password. We are required to test the code several times to make sure that the program runs smoothly and that all criteria are met.


*Here is an example of what that page looks like.*

This task was a bit more tricky and required a lot of research through google, youtube and help from other web developers. After making sure the CSS and HTML was working I got started in creating the javascript. The script included the numerical, alphabetical and special characters that are required to create the passwords. created several prompts to ask if the user would like to include various characters such as : capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. also created prompts in case user input either incorrect information or chose to cancel the creation all together. After several experiments I deemed the script completely functional and saw it met all required criteria.


List of acceptance criteria:
- GIVEN I need a new, secure password.
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password,
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
- WHEN prompted for password criteria,
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password.
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password,
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password,
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
- WHEN I answer each prompt,
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
- WHEN all prompts are answered,
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
- WHEN the password is generated,
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
